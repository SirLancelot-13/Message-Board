A Message-Board where you can write messages and view those written by other people, kind of like a large wall and free spray-paint cans for everyone. (Except you can't paint over other people's stuff lol).

This is a project to understand and implement concepts of Node.js and Express.js. Planned to be expanded upon with integration of PostgreSQL for storing messages in the future.
